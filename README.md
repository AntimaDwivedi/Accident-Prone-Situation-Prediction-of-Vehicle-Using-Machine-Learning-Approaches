# Accident-Prone-Situation-Prediction-of-Vehicle-Using-Machine-Learning-Approaches
Increase in the number of deaths due to road accidents every year sheerly due to negligence or emotional behavior
of drivers has become a major problem in India. People driving late at nights, especially truck drivers, due to
reasons such as fatigue, lethargy, long work hours and sleepiness, often lose control on the road and cause
accidents which may or may not be fatal to the passengers but surely results in loss. The best way to avoid these
kinds of fatal circumstances should be to avoid driving at all when not feeling up to the task.
Thus, the project proposes a model that is able to warn the driver whether the car cabin is prone to accidents or
not. This will be achieved by measuring various characteristics of the moving car such as:<br>
<b>[1]</b> Drowsiness state through the eyes (percentage of eye closure)<br>
<b>[2]</b> Drowsiness state through the mouth (yawning) of the driver.<br>
<b>[3]</b> Pulse detection of the driver to gauge his/her stress level.<br>
The main aim of the project is to predict the possibility of accident based on these characteristics according to
their respective thresholds in the form of discrete values. We have collected more than 2000 instance of data from
the real time observation and checked the accidents prone probability on that dataset with the help of machine
learning algorithm.<br><br><br>
The accuracy of machine learning models, based on these values shall help us in evaluating the features that must
be present in an accident prevention system inside a car cabin.
